# WineRack

## The plan is a client side C# dot net application with a Rust server side API. Since identity sort of matters, I may add in Duende/IdnetityServer if I can't find something else that I can implement.

### The idea!
An application for a home wine collector. They may have a wine rack system, they may have wire racks, they may keep things in boxes. The purpose is  to offer them a quick and consistent way to enter new purchases, add remarks to bottles, 
see their drinknig history and most impaortantly what they have laying (hopefully) around.

#### Part one:
This is getting the models and user stories down.
